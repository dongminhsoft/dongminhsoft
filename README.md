### [When Did the First Forms of Life Form in the Cosmos?  ](https://www.quora.com/profile/Dong-Minh-4/The-First-Forms-of-Life-in-the-Cosmos-The-James-Webb-Space-Telescope-has-confirmed-that-the-first-stars-formed-just-a-f)

The latest observations from the James Webb Space Telescope confirm that the first generation of stars formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. This aligns with predictions made over a decade ago, but it remains unclear how quickly these stars led to the formation of life. Essential elements such as carbon and oxygen were produced in these early stellar environments, yet the conditions necessary for life took time to develop.  

#### What Defines a Habitable World?  

Our standard definition of habitability is based on "life as we know it," which depends on liquid water and carbon-based chemistry. However, alternative life forms could exist in different environments, such as Titan’s methane and ethane lakes, suggesting that habitability might extend beyond Earth-like conditions. Some early stars, known as Carbon-Enriched Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars, were rich in carbon compared to iron. Planets forming around these stars may have been carbon-rich rather than iron-rich, potentially providing unique pathways for life’s emergence.  

#### Could Life Have Emerged Early in the Universe?  

While the necessary ingredients for life may have existed early on, conditions may not have been favorable. The early universe was bathed in intense radiation, and planetary formation was influenced by higher background temperatures. Cold debris disks, the known birthplaces of rocky planets, would have been warmer, possibly preventing stable planet formation at the time. Even after planets formed, heavy bombardment by asteroids and comets likely kept them inhospitable for hundreds of millions of years. On Earth, the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) appeared around 4.2 billion years ago—350 million years after the planet formed—suggesting that any early life-bearing planets would have followed a similar timeline.  

#### Can We Detect These Early Worlds?  

To find evidence of habitable planets from the early universe, we can study metal-poor stars in the Milky Way and search for transiting planets around them. The chemical makeup and orbital properties of these planets could reveal whether they had conditions suitable for life billions of years ago.  

#### Does This Deepen the Fermi Paradox?  

Not necessarily. If civilizations formed billions of years ago, most of them are likely long extinct. On Earth, only a fraction of the 117 billion humans who have ever lived are alive today. Similarly, ancient extraterrestrial civilizations may have vanished, leaving behind only relics. Instead of asking, “Where is everybody?” we should focus on searching for what they left behind.  

#### The Role of the First Stars in the Universe’s Evolution  

The first stars played a crucial role in shaping the universe. For the first hundred million years after the Big Bang, elements like carbon and oxygen did not exist. Once nuclear fusion ignited in these stars, the universe became chemically enriched, making planets and life possible.  

As we continue our search for extraterrestrial civilizations, we must consider the possibility that we are latecomers to the cosmic story. If advanced civilizations emerged billions of years ago, they may have already explored artificial intelligence and space travel. My research focuses on searching for traces of these past civilizations—learning from them could be humanity’s next great discovery.
